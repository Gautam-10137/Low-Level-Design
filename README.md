<h2>Low-Level Design </h2>

<p>
Low-level design transforms high-level specifications into detailed software plans by decomposing the system, defining modules, data structures, algorithms, interfaces, and database designs. It emphasizes precise details, error handling, and module-level implementation, facilitating efficient coding of the software system.

<h2>Real-World Projects:</h2>
<h1>1.The Parking Lot Management System </h1>
<p>
 <strong>Problem:</strong><br>
The Parking Lot Management System addresses the challenge of efficiently managing vehicle parking in a structured manner. The problem involves organizing parking slots, tracking vehicle entries and exits, calculating parking durations, and determining associated costs.<br><br>
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
<li>The solution is a Java-based Parking Lot Management System that employs object-oriented principles. Key classes like <strong>Vehicle, ParkingSlot, Ticket,</strong> and <strong>CostDetails</strong> capture essential data. The <strong>ParkingSlotManager</strong> efficiently handles slot occupancy, and subclasses specialize in two-wheeler and four-wheeler slots.</li>
<li>The <strong>ParkingLot</strong> class acts as the central hub, coordinating entry and exit through <strong>EntryGate</strong> and <strong>ExitGate</strong>. The <strong>ParkingLotController</strong> oversees system operations, and the <strong>ParkingLotFactory</strong> facilitates flexible parking lot creation.</li>
<li>A command-line interface in the <strong>Main</strong> class streamlines user interaction, allowing entry and exit processing and slot availability checks. This modular design ensures scalability, adaptability, and an intuitive user experience, providing a comprehensive solution for Parking Lot Management.</li>

<h1>2. Design a Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h1>
<p>
<li><strong>Tic-Tac-Toe</strong> project involves structuring game state, player input, rules, and winner determination. </li>
<li><strong>Low-level design</strong> breaks it into modules: initialization, input handling, game logic, and UI. Using data structures like a 2D array and algorithms for victory, we ensure a well-structured, responsive, and intuitive <strong>Tic-Tac-Toe</strong> experience.

<h1>3. Design a Vehicle Rental System</h1>
<p>
 <strong>Problem:</strong>
<li> The challenge involves building a Vehicle Rental System that adeptly manages <strong>users, stores, vehicles, and reservations.
</strong></li>
 <li>Users are expected to input personal details, create new <storng>stores,</strong> and add <strong>vehicles</strong> while making reservations for available vehicles at different locations. </li>
 <li>The system must effectively handle aspects like <strong>pick-up</strong> and <strong>drop-off</strong> locations, reservation<strong> durations</strong>, and various operational features such as confirming, canceling, and viewing reservations. </li>
 <br>
 <strong>Solution:</strong>
<li>The Java-based <strong>Vehicle Rental System</strong> features a text interface, managing users, stores, vehicles, and reservations. Key functions include <strong>user addition, store creation,</strong> and <strong>vehicle addition </strong>for reservations at various locations.</li>
<li> The system efficiently handles <strong>pick-up/drop-off, reservation durations,</strong> and operations like <strong>confirmation, cancellation, and viewing.</strong></li>
<li> It embraces <strong>modularity,</strong> input validation, and enums for clarity, ensuring a seamless vehicle rental experience.</li>
